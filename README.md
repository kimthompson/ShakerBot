# ShakerBot

## Initial notes from the FC Leader

I've attached the main bot, bot.js, along with the config.json file, and the package.json file that I think I need to include. Some wires got crossed, so it has some extraneous stuff in it.

You'll need to make sure you've got node and npm installed, then run:

`npm install discord.js`
 
Then to run the bot, you'll need to run

`node bot.js`

I have access to the !sleep command, and I haven't made a README yet, so if you have any questions, please let me know.
